# üõ∞Ô∏è GeoNauts

**GeoNauts** is a spatial data validation pipeline that detects and corrects mismatches in topology access characteristics ‚Äî such as pedestrian access incorrectly allowed on highways. This project won **1st place at the HERE Technologies Student Hackathon ‚Äì April 2025** üèÜ

## üåç Project Scope

The core issue revolves around HERE's Validation Rule `WSIGN406`, which triggers when a regulatory sign (typically a pedestrian restriction) is incorrectly associated with a road segment that permits pedestrian access. These mismatches often result from automated processes that associate signs to topologies without accounting for their intended context ‚Äî for example, linking a motorway sign to an adjacent pedestrian path.

These validation triggers can arise from several root causes:

We defined 4 core cases of validation outcomes based on HERE's internal rules:

- **Case 1 ‚Äì No sign in reality**: The violation is invalid because the sign no longer exists in the real world.  
  _Fix: Remove the sign from the dataset._

- **Case 2 ‚Äì Wrong sign-to-road association**: The sign exists, but it is incorrectly associated with the wrong road segment.  
  _Fix: Replace the associated topology with the correct nearby one._

- **Case 3 ‚Äì Incorrect road attribution**: The sign is correctly placed on the right topology, but that topology incorrectly allows pedestrian access.  
  _Fix: Update the topology‚Äôs `accessCharacteristics` to set pedestrian access to false._

- **Case 4 ‚Äì Legitimate exception**: The pedestrian access is valid, even though it triggers the validation rule.  
  _Fix: Mark the violation as a legitimate exception and take no further action._

Our project automates the correction of these mismatches using spatial heuristics, connected topology analysis, and rule-based validation.

We processed 60+ violations across European tiles and proposed corrections using:
- **Nearby topology matching**
- **Pedestrian access overflow checks**
- **Node chain analysis**
- **Topology flag updates**
- **Structured logging (CSV + GeoJSON)**

Our approach ensures this pipeline can scale globally by modularizing region-specific heuristics.

> During the hackathon, our pipeline correctly and accurately classified **25 validations** with fixes applied in just **3.5 minutes**.  
> With more time and data, our approach is scalable and can handle significantly more cases beyond the initial scope.

## üöÄ What It Does

The pipeline:
1. Collects and combines all validation data from partitions.
2. Enriches each validation with its corresponding topology.
3. Identifies and corrects mismatches in pedestrian/car access (e.g., sidewalks vs motorways).
4. Replaces inappropriate topologies with more appropriate nearby ones.
5. Analyzes connected topologies via node chains to detect inconsistencies.
6. Logs everything to a `results.csv` file and generates human-readable `.txt` reports.

## üèÜ Award

**Winner of the HERE Technologies Student Hackathon ‚Äì April 2025**  
Our team was awarded **1st place** for designing the most innovative and scalable solution. As a result, we earned internship offers at HERE Technologies for Summer 2025!

The challenge: **Automatically correcting spatial validations**.  
We focused on violations triggered by **motorway signs incorrectly associated with pedestrian-accessible roads** (Validation Rule `WSIGN406`), and built a fully automated pipeline to clean and correct the map data.
